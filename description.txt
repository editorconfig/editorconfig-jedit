EditorConfig helps developers define and maintain consistent coding styles
between different editors and IDEs. The EditorConfig project consists of a file
format for defining coding styles and a collection of text editor plugins that
enable editors to read the file format and adhere to defined styles.
EditorConfig files are easily readibly and they work nicely with version
control systems.

This is the EditorConfig plugin of jEdit. For more information, please visit
